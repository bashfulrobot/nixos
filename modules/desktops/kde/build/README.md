# Plasma Config Notes

## Panel

The panel is a bit of a pain to configure. Plasma Managaer cannot do the panel.

- I set up my panel using the gui, which writes to `~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc`
- I then copied that file to `modules/desktops/kde/build/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc`
- and use home manager to place the file

### Potential Issues

- Will new changes to the panel in gui be lost? Or how to capture?

## HDR

- [ ] Until I find where it is stored, I have to manually enable HDR.

- `Settings` > `Display and Monitor` > `Enable HDR`

## Wallpaper

The wallpaper is set in the `plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc` file.

- I set up my panel using the gui, which writes to `~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc`
- I then copied that file to `modules/desktops/kde/build/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc`
