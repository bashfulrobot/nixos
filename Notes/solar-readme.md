Open solaar, unlock the setting "Key/Button Diversion". In the dropdown select "Snipping Tool" and set it to "Diverted". Then click on "Rule Editor", create a new rule for the Key "Snipping Tool" and then add an action to execute a shell command. In my case I use XFCE so I'm using the command "xfce4-screenshooter" to open the screenshot tool when pressed. I think in Ubuntu you can use the command "gnome-screenshot -w" to make a screenshot.
